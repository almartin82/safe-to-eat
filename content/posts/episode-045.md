I'll be posting about one of these a week for several months. When you've read them all, I'll ask you to vote for a favorite, so remember which ones you liked]</p> <p>\"Just as we don't accept students using AI to write their essays, we will not accept districts using AI to supplant the critical role of teachers.\"</p> <p>— Arthur Steinberg, American Federation of Teachers‑PA, reacting to Alpha's cyber‑charter bid, January 2025</p> <p>In January 2025, the charter school application of \"<a href= \"https://www.unbound.school/\">Unbound Academy</a>\", a subsidiary of \"<a href=\"https://2hourlearning.com/\">2 Hour Learning, Inc</a>\", lit up the education press: two hours of \"AI‑powered\" academics, 2.6x learning velocity, and zero teachers. Sympathetic reporters repeated the slogans; union leaders reached for pitchforks; Reddit muttered \"<a href= \"https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/17feoeu/a_school_with_no_teachers_alpha_private_school_in/\">another rich‑kid scam</a>.\" More sophisticated critics dismissed the pitch as \"selective data from expensive private schools\".</p> <p>But there is nowhere on the internet that provides a detailed, non-partisan, description of what the \"2 hour learning\" program actually is, let alone an objective third party analysis to back up its claims.</p> <p>2-Hour Learning's flagship school is the \"Alpha School\" in Austin Texas. The <a href=\"https://alpha.school/\">Alpha homepage</a> makes three claims:</p> <ol> <li>Love School</li> <li>Learn 2X in two-hours per day</li> <li>Learn Life Skills</li> </ol> <p>Only the second claim seems to be controversial, which may be exactly why that is the claim the Alpha PR team focuses on. That PR campaign makes three more sub-claims on what the two-hour, 2x learning really means:</p> <ol> <li>\"Learn 2.6X faster.\" (on average)</li> <li>\"Only two hours of academics per day.\"</li> <li>\"Powered by AI (not teachers).\"</li> </ol> <p>If all of this makes your inner Bayesian flinch, you're in good company. After twenty‑odd years of watching shiny education fixes wobble and crash—KIPP, AltSchool, Summit Learning, One-laptop-per-child, No child left behind, MOOCs, Khan‑for‑Everything—you should be skeptical. Either Alpha is (a) another program for the affluent propped up by selection effects, or (b) a clever way to turn children into joyless speed‑reading calculators. Those were, more or less, the two critical camps that emerged when Alpha's parent company was approved to launch the tuition‑free Arizona charter school this past January.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the public evidence base on whether this is \"real\" is thin in both directions. Alpha's own material is glossy and elliptical; mainstream coverage either repeats Alpha's talking points, or attacks the premise that kids should even be allowed to learn faster than their peers. Until Raj Chetty installs himself in the hallway with a clipboard counting MAP percentiles it is hard to get real information on what exactly Alpha is doing, whether it is actually working beyond selection effects, and if there is anyway it could scale in a way that all the other education initiatives seemed to fail to do.</p> <p>I first heard about Alpha in May 2024, and in the absence of randomized‑controlled clarity, I did what any moderately obsessive parent with three elementary-aged kids and an itch for data would do: I moved the family across the country to Austin for a year and ran the experiment myself (unfortunately, despite trying my best we never managed to have identical twins, so I stopped short of running a proper control group. My wife was less disappointed than I was).</p> <p>Since last autumn I've collected the sort of on‑the‑ground detail that doesn't surface in press releases, or is available anywhere online: long chats with founders, curriculum leads, \"guides\" (not teachers), Brazilian Zoom coaches, sceptical parents, ecstatic parents, and the kids who live inside the Alpha dashboard – including my own. I hope this seven-part review can help share what the program actually is and that this review is more open minded than the critics, but is something that would never get past an Alpha public relations gatekeeper:</p> <p><a class= \"text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700 text-sm transition-colors duration-200 ease-in-out\" href= \"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-alpha-school\"><em>https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-alpha-school</em></a></p>"

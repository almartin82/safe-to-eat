original_description: "Kevin Kelly is a writer and a founding executive editor of <em>Wired Magazine</em>. He is the author of <em>What Technology Wants</em>, <em>Out of Control</em> and <em>The Inevitable: Understanding the Twelve Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future</em>.“I always try to write about the future—and it became harder and harder because things would catch up so fast. If you read <em>Out of Control</em> now, I’ve heard that people say, ‘well, this is obvious.’ I have to tell you, it was dismissed as entirely pie-in-the-sky, wild-eyed craziness twenty-five years ago."

original_title: Searching For Hobey Baker, Episode 1 The Natural
original_subtitle: ""
original_description: "Narrated by David Duchovny, Searching for Hobey Baker re-contextualizes and brings to life the story of one of the greatest college athletes who has largely been lost to history.

After Hobey Baker makes his triumphant Princeton hockey debut against Williams, we travel back to his early days attending St. Paul’s School in New Hampshire. He develops a reputation as both an athletic phenom and a kind, generous sportsman. After the economic crash of 1907, his father struggles to send him to college at Princeton where he becomes a two-sport star in football and hockey. After graduation, Hobey embarks on a summer motorcycle trip around Europe – a grand experience interrupted by the ominous clouds of conflict circling the continent."

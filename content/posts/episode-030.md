original_description: "<p>In terms of the depth and range of topics, this episode is the best I’ve done.</p><p>No part of my worldview is the same after talking with Carl Shulman. He's the most interesting intellectual you've never heard of.</p><p>We ended up talking for 8 hours, so I'm splitting this episode into 2 parts.</p><p>This part is about Carl’s model of an intelligence explosion, which integrates everything from:</p><p>* how fast algorithmic progress and hardware improvements in AI are happening,</p><p>* what primate evolution suggests about the scaling hypothesis,</p><p>* how soon before AIs could do large parts of AI research themselves, and whether there would be faster and faster doublings of AI researchers,</p><p>* how quickly robots produced from existing factories could take over the economy.</p><p>We also discuss the odds of a takeover based on whether the AI is aligned before the intelligence explosion happens, and Carl explains why he’s more optimistic than Eliezer.</p><p>The next part, which I’ll release next week, is about all the specific mechanisms of an AI takeover, plus a whole bunch of other galaxy brain stuff.</p><p>Maybe 3 people in the world have thought as rigorously as Carl about so many interesting topics. This was a huge pleasure.</p>"
